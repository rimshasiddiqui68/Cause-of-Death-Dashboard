# Cause of Death Dashboard

Every number in this report represents a person—a life lived, a story shared, and a loss deeply felt by their loved ones. Examining data about causes of death is not easy, but it helps us identify patterns and work toward preventing similar losses in the future.

This analysis covers data from **202 countries** over the years **1990 to 2019**, focusing on **31 causes of death**. The data was sourced from the **Our World in Data** website. To prepare the dataset, I performed data cleaning in Excel. Since continent information was missing, I added it using external data and merged it with the original dataset through XLOOKUP. After checking data types, removing unnecessary columns, and unpivoting the columns related to causes of death for better analysis, the data was ready for visualization.

As I explored the data, several key questions emerged for analysis:
1. How have the number of deaths changed over time—did they increase or decline?
2. Which countries have the highest mortality rates?
3. What are the top communicable and non-communicable diseases causing deaths, and what are their death rates?
4. Do death rates stay consistent across countries, or do they vary significantly?
5. Which diseases have the highest mortality rates globally?

To make the insights easier to understand, I created a map visualization, which provides a clear picture of the global trends in causes of death.
